        <p>Hi! I'm Carolyn, a first year studying CS (with a prospective minor in
            public policy, but we'll see). You can probably spot me running in an orange
            hat w/Cal Tri, humming, or drinking milk. :3</p>

            <ul>
               <li>One thing I learned from this article was the sheer myriad of choices one has
                when creating a design. I, for one, didn't even notice that the amount of likes
                and retweets for a Twitter post was bolded until this article pointed it out.
               </li>
               <li>My favorite part was how the author suggested not only to use apps, but also
                to study them. It's nice to know that you can incorporate a designer mindset into
                your daily life too.
