							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found the article detailing the various psychologies of focus and UI/UX design very interesting. I learned about how people
								can actually classify different kinds of attention, such as focused versus divided attention, and use it to improve UI/UX design.
							I learned that decision-making time based on the number of features is actually a logarithmic curve, which is actually something called Hick's Law. Reading
						this article showed me how powerful the underlying psychological factors were in the websites we see and interfaces we use that even I was not aware of. </p>
