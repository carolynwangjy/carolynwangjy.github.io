					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One thing I learned from this article is that when choosing  fonts, it's important
								to consider the audience in mind. For example, young children who are just learning how to read
							read might prefer "highly generous, legible" fonts like Sassoon Primary. Senior citizens, on the otherhand, might 
						prefer simple fonts that are highly readable, without too much decoration. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was all the resources that the article provided. For example, it provided links to
								repos with 100s of fonts for inspiration. There were also typography resources and font pairing inspiration/sources such
							as Typewolf and FontPair. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"Typography is all about experimentation. It’s both a science and an art."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
