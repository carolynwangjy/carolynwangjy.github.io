                            <p> In this week's article, I learned the amazing animations one can create. Some involve well-animated transitions, while others 
                                involve active/continuous gifs. All of them create an intuitive, interactive experience for the user. </p>

                            <p> My favorite part of the article was seeing all the different cool interactive designs people could make. Some involved animations that'd occur
                                with user actions like scrolling. Others would be animated on the spot. All of them made the websites/apps much more fun to look at and use.</p>

                            <p> [My favorite designs in the article was the "Landing Page Concept" by Anton Mikhaltsov and InVision Studio by Charles Patterson. The landing page
                                concept was intuitive, clean, and a great design for a personal portfolio. InVision Studio had easy-to-visualize photos, and zoom-in animation features that
                                were super fun to look at. Overall, both of them were super user-friendly, simple to navigate, and aesthicially-pleasing.
